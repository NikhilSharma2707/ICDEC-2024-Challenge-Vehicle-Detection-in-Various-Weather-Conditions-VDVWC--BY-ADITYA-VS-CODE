# Vehicle Detection In Various Weather Conditions 

This project focuses on developing an object detection model using YOLOv5, with images categorized under different weather conditions (Rainy, Sunny) and times of day (Day, Night). The model is trained to detect various vehicle types and transportation modes, including cars, motorcycles, auto rickshaws, and more.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- Annotation Folder: Contains the annotations for the images, categorized into subfolders based on weather conditions (Rainy, Sunny) and time of day (Day, Night).
- Train Folder: Contains the training images, organized similarly to the annotation folder.
- Val Folder: Contains the validation images, following the same organization.
